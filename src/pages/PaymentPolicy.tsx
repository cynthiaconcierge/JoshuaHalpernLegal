                Legal Halp ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to transparency in how we price, bill, and handle payments for our legal services. This Payment &amp; Refund Policy outlines the terms that apply when you purchase legal services or products through our website (www.legalhalplaw.com) or through direct engagement with our firm.

                1. Flat-Fee Pricing
              </h2>
              <p>
                Legal Halp operates on a flat-fee model. The cost of each service or legal package is clearly stated on our website or provided in writing before any engagement begins. There are no hidden fees, hourly billing surprises, or retainer requirements unless explicitly agreed upon in a signed engagement agreement.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-3">
                2. Payment Methods
              </h2>
              <p>
                We accept payments via credit card, debit card, and ACH bank transfer through our secure payment processor (Stripe). All transactions are encrypted and processed in accordance with industry-standard security protocols. We do not store your full payment details on our servers.
              </p>

                3. When Payment Is Due
              </h2>
              <p>
                Full payment is required before work begins unless otherwise specified in a written engagement agreement. For certain multi-phase projects, a payment schedule may be arranged at our discretion and confirmed in writing prior to commencement.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                Because legal services require significant time, expertise, and preparation, refunds are handled as follows:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-slate-700">
                <li>
                  <strong>Before work begins:</strong> If you cancel your engagement before any substantive legal work has been performed and before any documents or materials have been delivered, you may request a full refund. Refund requests must be submitted in writing to{" "}
                  <a href="mailto:assistant@legalhalp.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 underline">

                  .
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>After work has begun:</strong> Once substantive legal work has commenced—including but not limited to research, drafting, filing, or consultation—payments are non-refundable. This applies regardless of whether final deliverables have been provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Digital products and templates:</strong> All sales of downloadable legal templates, guides, and digital materials are final and non-refundable once the product has been delivered or access has been granted.

                5. Scope of Services
              </h2>
              <p>
                Each flat-fee engagement covers a clearly defined scope of work as outlined in your engagement agreement. Work that falls outside the original scope may require an additional fee, which will be discussed and agreed upon in writing before any additional work is performed.

                7. Late Payments
              </h2>
              <p>
                For engagements with payment schedules, payments are expected on or before the agreed-upon due dates. Legal Halp reserves the right to pause or suspend work on any matter for which payment is overdue until the outstanding balance is resolved.
